## 📖 Description
SmartQR Payment Gateway for BanglaQR is a payment gateway for WooCommerce websites operating in Bangladesh. Built to support the unified **BanglaQR** national standard launched by Bangladesh Bank, this plugin enables merchants to accept payments from any bank app or mobile financial services (MFS) including **bKash, Nagad, Rocket, Upay, CellFin, and bank transfers**.

During checkout, customers receive a scan-to-pay QR popup modal. They can scan the QR code from their mobile apps, complete the payment, and upload their payment screenshot or receipt before checking out. 

Backend administrators can configure multiple QR codes, assign customized processing bank fees/percentage charges per QR, and check customer-uploaded payment receipts inside the WooCommerce order review screen.
